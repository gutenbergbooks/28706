<p class="author"><i>The Author.</i></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>Beginning with June 9, 1904, there was a column of verse and prose
published in "The Stillwater Advance" under the caption "Oklahoma
Sunshine." These were written in the moments of a busy life, amid the
crowding of sterner things, and many of them found a wide circulation in
the fugitive publications of the day. So many persons have offered
expressions of being pleased and helped by them that they are here
presented in a more permanent form. The following comprise the year from
June, 1904, to June, 1905.</p>

<p>If the girl with a white muslin dress and a picture hat has any troubles
in this world she has a wonderful skill in hiding her real feelings.</p>

<p>Somehow, those men who are all the time telling how well money talks,
never get well enough acquainted with it to speak with authority.</p>

<p>"De worst objection to de wortersmillion in Oklahomy," said a
Mississippi black man, "is de fact dat it gits ripe too late fer de
wheat harvest an' too yarly fer de cotton-pickin."</p>

<p>The average man grieves more when he runs out of chewing tobacco and the
nearest neighbor who uses the filthy weed is three miles away, than he
does when the mortgage takes the farm. Upon what little things doth
happiness depend!</p>

<p>It's no use to try to trot in a race where you are out-classed. Better
be a good weed-puller at so much per pull, than a member of the
legislature without any pull at all.</p>

<p>If a woman's hair is smoothed up, her hat on straight and her belt all
right behind, the other cares and responsibilities of this life sink at
once and forever into insignificant nothingness.</p>

<p>This thing of "hitching your wagon to a star" may be all right for a

on faith. I don't know for certain that the devil has split hoofs and a
forked tail and carries a four-tined fork along with him in the hope of

to both that it keeps a fellow on the dodge between smiles and tears.</p>

<h2><a name="Rainy_Weather" id="Rainy_Weather"></a>Rainy Weather.</h2>


<p>Our Mud Creek correspondent sends us the following items, having to do
with the recent wet weather:</p>

<p>"Bill Hughes cut his wheat last week. He rigged up a header attachment
to a row-boat, and nipped the heads off at the surface of the water.</p>

<p>"It rained so fast last Saturday night at Tad Wilson's that the water
couldn't all run off the roof of his new house. The water stood four
inches deep on top of the comb for over half an hour. Then Tad took an
ax and sharpened the comb so it would split the drops better, and the
water soon ran down.</p>

<p>"Jem Bilkins' incubator hatched last Wednesday during the heavy rain.
Jem set only Plymouth Rock eggs; but, when they hatched, over half of
his chickens were ducks. They were given web feet by an accommodating
providence."</p>

<p>He was a four year old Oklahoma Fountleroy, in knee pants, and with
golden curls that would make an angel envious. His face still wore the
divine beauty of the cradle, and his large, luminous eyes reflected an
innocence unspotted of the world.</p>

<p>But the carpenter on the building did not appreciate his company. He was
always in the way. So the carpenter thought he would frighten him away,
by a story of horrible danger.</p>

<p>"Do you see that big man coming there?" said the carpenter to him.</p>

<p>The child nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the carpenter; "you would better run away before he
gets you. That big man eats a boy for breakfast every morning, and he
may eat you."</p>

<p>A look of ineffable scorn slowly penetrated beneath the curls. The
large, innocent eyes took on an expression of supreme contempt. Then the
angel indifferently said:</p>

<p>"I ate a boy once; he was a nigger!"</p>

<p>The man that can't find any heaven in this world of sunshine has no
promise of getting a chance to hunt for it in the next.</p>

<p>David said in his haste that all men are liars; and the Good Book does
not record that he took it back after he had plenty of time to think it
over.</p>

<p>The sublime faith that moves mountains and conquers kingdoms is
frequently helpless and hopeless against the clatter of a garrulous
tongue.</p>

<p>Wealth comes from toil and sacrifice, but the treasures of the heart are

<p>"With all your talk about necessary house-hold implements," said Sooner

ordinary, every-day frying pan, that you chuck under your buck-board or

stoves, potato-mashers, coffee-strainers and all the
everlasting tribe of culinary jim-cracks have to turn out of the trail
for the frying pan and give it the right of way.</p>

<p>"With the frying pan for his companion, the civilized idiot is at home
any where,&mdash;prairie or woods, creek bank or deer-lick or prairie-chicken
trysting place. With a frying pan and some bacon fat, home is never far
away, and a full meal is so near that heaven comes close to the hungry
man. It has fought more battles, made more forced marches and won more
victories than Napoleon. It has surveyed lands, bunched cattle and
soonered claims. It has done all the pioneering for the frontiers-man.

its exalted circumference of life-sustaining food, what chafing-dish or
modern steam-cooker was ever waited on by such a willing appetite?</p>

<p>"When I die," continued Sooner Dave, "I want a frying pan chiseled on my
tomb-stone; for it has been the sole companion of the truest happiness I
have known in this world. And if over in the next world there is a
chance to choose one's crown after the style and finish the wearer may
desire, I am going to take my faithful old frying pan along and wear it
for a few thousand years just to show the angels how much a man can
appreciate good things!"</p>

<p>The "Sooners" may have their faults, but as a general propositions they
are to be preferred to the "laters." Every good thing that has blest
mankind since Adam had his celebrated adventure with green goods in the
Garden of Eden, has been discovered, invented, dug out or dug up, by a
"sooner." He has always been a dare-devil whose courage was so prominent
as to attract the envy and malice of every "later" that whittled
dry-goods boxes into splinters and used his time to cuss "the
government." God bless the whole "sooner" tribe, say I, from Adam down

<p>Some people act on an idea that work is so sacred they fear to touch it
least they profane its divine nature.</p>

<p>Opportunity is a beautiful bird, but so shy that it feeds on the wing
and never alights long enough for a common man to pluck its plumage.</p>

<p>Every man has within him the essentials of exalted greatness; but most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of us are so enmeshed in small follies that the greatness cannot break
through.</p>

<p>Some people do all they can to make others uncomfortable, and call it
their religion.</p>

<p>The love which is so superfine that it can't find a place for its home
in this world is entirely too good for a hearty welcome in the next one.</p>

<p>The reason why the preachers don't have larger congregations must be on
account of their not wanting to call the sinners but the righteous to
repentance, and there is always plenty of room.</p>

<p>The fellow who starts out to do the greatest good to the greatest
number, generally concludes that the greatest number is No. 1.</p>

<p>Amid the thunder and the crash of worlds, the chief question after all

<p>Nothing takes a man down so much as to contrast what he is with what he
meant to be.</p>

<p>Some people are so sure they are going to miss hell in the hereafter
that they proceed to make as much as possible while in this world.</p>

true he must saw lots of wood in order to keep up the fires in his

<p>Don't go too much on the sensibilities. Feelings are a mighty poor
regulator when it comes to determining the necessity for hard work.</p>

<p>The days of the gray hairs and wrinkled brows utter few petitions to the
merry god of all the happy Christmas eves; but if they asked of Santa
Claus the supremest gift in all the world of men, they would implore him
for one more Christmas as happy and as innocent as smiled upon them in
the days of childhood long ago!</p>

<p>When Hope comes on the scene, Trouble has urgent business over in the
next settlement.</p>

<p>Don't wait to plant a flower for your neighbor until it has to blossom
beside his tomb-stone.</p>

<p>Growling at the weather may give the tongue plenty of exercise, but it
never buys meat and potatoes or swells the bank account.</p>

<p>Be confident. No coward heart ever won an important battle, and the
battle-field of life is the one that demands the fullest courage.</p>

<p>Be thankful as long as there is a buttered side to your bread; and when
the butter runs out, thank God for the bread!</p>

<p>Charity covers the sins all right, but many a poor sinner gets mighty
short of blankets in the cold winter times of folly.</p>

<p>One heart of love and two glad lips of song have lifted many a mediocre
soul up the slopes of happiness to the bright, eternal morning.</p>

<p>There is more religion in a home full of bread and butter than a hotel
full of canvas-back and terrapin.</p>

<p>If the Lord sends a tin-cup full of happiness, don't spend your time
upbraiding Him for not supplying a ship-load.</p>

<p>Some people are so unreasonable that if the Lord sent them a turkey they
would raise a row because he didn't furnish a barrel of cranberries,
too.</p>

your name down on the books.</p>

<p>Don't expect to hold down a claim in the New Jerusalem unless you live

<span class="i0">It would be the direst folly for the timid, helpless ones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To combat the deadly bullets of his thunder-spitting guns!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's a better way to foil him,&mdash;'tis a way beyond compare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Resolved by all the animals through all the South and West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Mister Roosevelt comes along we'll take a quiet rest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll stay at home delightedly and all his dogs and guns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never find us where we dwell with wives and little ones!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O'er dale and desert, wood and plain, each to his ingle-side!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hid themselves so closely that no hunter cared to roam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where these the timid subjects each had fashioned him a home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were too wise for Teddy and they still life's blessings share,<br /></span>

<p>Blood tells when it comes to annuities and allotments.</p>

<p>God made the country, but it never fruited till the boomer boomed it.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>The greatest heroes of the world are not those extolled in song or
glorified with monuments and statues. They are the undiscovered ones who
in tears and darkness lived their uttermost for the accomplishments of
lofty purposes and failed utterly just before the triumph came.</p>

<p>All town-sites look alike on the map.</p>

<p>A claim in the run is worth two in the lottery.</p>

<p>One contest beats a fire, and two are worse than a ship-wreck.</p>

<p>A stake on a home-stead is more valuable than a palace on an Indian
allotment.</p>

<p>As smoke to the eyes and vinegar to the teeth, so is a contest to the
poor man seeking a home.</p>

<p>Charity is the first lesson in the school of righteousness.</p>

<p>The religion that feeds only the heart can never hope to save hungry

<p>Faith is a great heart-cleaner.</p>

<p>The godly man never worries over hell-fire.</p>

<p>Good intentions never make the dollars ring in the collection plate.</p>

<p>A man's meanness and woman's frailty make a pair that prayer can't beat
when they get together.</p>

<p>The Devil never attends the church of a scolding preacher. He knows that
his presence is unnecessary.</p>

<p>If you want a balance in your favor on God's books, see to it that there
is no balance against you on the books of men.</p>

<p>At the birth-hour of every soul, there overhangs a divine plan directing
its plans and purposes. That plan is holy and immaculate; it has neither
spot nor blemish; and as the soul walks out upon the highways of its
life, dim whispers and faint intuitions try to teach the road it ought
to travel to the stars. Happy the man who understands the story and
walks with unerring feet the divine lanes of life and light until the
shadows fall again!</p>

<p>Fast people demand a religion trained to their own pace.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the teachings of conventional theology and
its peculiar dogmas, it is undeniable that a moral and an upright manner
of living secures the highest happiness for the human family. If death
is only a passage-way to eternal sleep, still a goodly life is worth the
living for the little years of this world only.</p>

mean act. The world's esteemed immortals have survived the shadows of
oblivion only because of precious deeds they wrought for fellow men. The

<p>The man who has only two hands has none to spare for his neighbor's
business.</p>

<p>Some people get up and fool around in the dark so they can grumble at
the lack of sunshine.</p>

<p>The man who laughs in the sunshine and sleeps when the shadows fall will
never suffer much with the heart-ache.</p>

<p>With all the strife and struggle after riches, the greatest joys of life
are forever more the gifts of nature, within the reach of rich and poor
alike, and beyond the measurings of gold. The clear sky and the green
grass, the sunshine of the noon, and the dew of the morning, the blossom
and the bird-song, good health and sound sleep, and the love of a man
for a woman and of a woman for a man,&mdash;these have no prices in the
catalogues of wealth and poverty alike.</p>
